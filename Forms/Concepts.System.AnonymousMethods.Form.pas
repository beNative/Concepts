unit Concepts.System.AnonymousMethods.Form;

{ Form demonstrating the variable (not value) capturing by anonymous methods.
  The scope is limited to only the routine where the anonymous method is
  defined, and not any other data in scope from that routine (as I thought at
  first was the case). }

  Alan Bauer:

  Anonymous methods (aka. Closures) capture the variables from the outer scope
  that are referenced within the body of the method itself. This is the
  intended behavior as it serves to extend the lifetime of the variable to
  match that of the anonymous method itself. This should not be confused with
  capturing the value of a variable. In my previous posts, A Sink Programming
  and More A Sink Kronos Programming, I demonstrated a technique for
  asynchronously dispatching an anonymous method from a background thread
  into the main UI thread. I also mentioned how there was a potential
  race-condition on the SR local variable. The simple, yet not very scalable,
  way of eliminating this race was to pause the loop by calling EndInvoke()
  prior to accessing SR again (in the FindNext() call). This time, I’m going to
  show a technique for capturing the value of the SR.Name field and not the
  whole SR variable. This will eliminate the race on the SR variable because
  the anonymous method body will no longer need to access it.
