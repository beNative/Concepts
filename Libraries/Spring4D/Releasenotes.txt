- added support for TBytes to TGUID conversion
- added record to string for displaying in test signature
- added Except and Intersect to TEnumerable


Release 1.1 - 12.09.2014

Fixed bugs:

- interface sometimes were wrongly treated as delegate types (issue #23)
- component registration was treated as recursive (issue #18)
- resolving an interface as one of its parent types raised invalid cast (issue #20)
- of a delegate type derived interface was not recognized as such
- a type that was explicitly registered as lazy type was not resolved properly
- a delegate type was registered twice
- generic type argument(s) of a possibly lazy type could not be found
- TRttiTypeHelper.GetGenericArguments was broken
- state of some iterator classes was not set to finished correctly
